            <p class="profile">With a flair for exquisite design, self-directed pastry professional. I discovered my
                passion for the science of baking and the art of designing. I unites these qualities and has been
                surprising guests with my culinary creativity for over two decades.

                I often ventures out of Singapore, exploring other Asian countries in search of inspiration to
                enhance my pastry skills. The fervent learner constantly upgrades myself with professional courses to
                expand my knowledge</p>

            <h1>Our Recepie</h1>
            <p>Our list truly runs the gamut of American dining, from legendary burgers, hot dogs, pizzas and fried
                chicken to lesser-known regional specialties; from dishes that go back more than a century to ones that
                have only been around for a decade but have accomplished a lot since then; from blue-collar classics
                whose inventors are long forgotten to fine-dining touchstones created by legendary chefs. These dishes
                tell the story of American dining through the years, and they’re all undeniably iconic </p>

                    <h3>Low-Calorie Ginger-Lime Vinaigrette Dressing Recipe</h3>
                    <p>Just like all our recipes, this one is adaptable. If the combo of ginger and jalapeño is too much
                        for you, swap it out with your favorite pepper of choice.That's when our tasty, tangy,
                        vegan-friendly ginger-lime vinaigrette comes in.much more exciting and elaborate in ingredients
                        and taste that that of your average balsamic vinegar and olive oil blended dressing</p>

                    <h3>Grilled Chicken Sandwich With Chimichurri Sauce</h3>
                    <p>This grilled chicken sandwich delivers heroic flavor by employing chimichurri, an Argentine
                        herb-based sauce that would make shoe leather taste like fine dining, along with a solid
                        supporting cast of sweet peppers, sharp raw onions, and peppery greens. Good luck finding a side
                        salad, let alone a real sandwich, at a restaurant for 310 calories.

                    <h3>Keto Butter-Baked Salmon and Asparagus Recipe</h3>
                    <p>Salmon and asparagus are always great together grilled, but this baked salmon recipe is even more
                        appropriate for keto diet followers because it adds more delicious fat to the omega-3 fatty
                        acids found naturally in salmon. The hint of lemon in the mayo-based topping is delicious on the
                        asparagus, too.</p>
